# Bernardo-Neres_AI_CA2
Working on CA2 for AI project 4 Year 

The idea of this project is to analyze a puzzle represented by a graph and explore topics such as the differences between graphs and trees, discuss the advantages of visualization, and analyze and demonstrate how Dijkstra's algorithm works when it is necessary to find the shortest path. And compare the performance of the Dijkstra and A* algorithms by implementing both and evaluating the solutions generated in terms of heuristics, complexity and processing time.
